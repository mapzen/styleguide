Styleguide
==========

Mapzen Styleguide makes it easy for us to create right-looking websites that
work well across platforms and into the future. If youâ€™re publishing Mapzen
stuff, the guide is for you.

ðŸ”‹ Batteries included:

* [Basic page structure](https://mapzen.com/common/styleguide/index.html) with
  standard linked CSS and Javascript resources.
* [Sample UI components](https://mapzen.com/common/styleguide/ui-components.html)
  like navigation, social buttons, search boxes, and pagination that can be
  combined to make new kinds of pages.
* [Complete sample pages](https://mapzen.com/common/styleguide/#sample-pages)
  like blog posts and developer documentation showing how all the pieces fit
  together.
