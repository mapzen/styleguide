# Common computing and coding terms

Follow these guidelines when writing about activities involving a computer or code.

## User interface elements

- When interacting with a user interface, you _click_ an item that you expect to be in a desktop context. For documentation about mobile products, you _tap_ an item.
- Use _press_ only when referring to items that you physically press, such as keys on a keyboard. Do not write, "Press the button."
- When describing cascading menus or breadcrumbs, it is okay to use the caret symbol (>) to show the hierarchy. For example, _click File > New Tab_.
- In most cases, you do not need to add a description of the user interface element. For example, _click Download_, instead of _click the Download button_. This simplifies the documentation and avoids ambiguity over what to call the particular element.

## Open source and open-source (and other cases of hyphenation)

- Whether or not to hyphenate open source depends on how these terms are used.
- When open source is a compound adjective, which is an adjective made up of multiple words, you should hyphenate. For example, you should use a hyphen for _open-source software_ or _open-source project_.
- Do not use a hyphen with in a sentence such as, "The code is open source."
- Do not use a hyphen with adverbs, such as "a beautifully created map".
- Follow the same guidelines when writing with other adjectives, compound adjectives, and adverbs. For example: _real-time communication_ versus _the communication is in real time_.

## General computing terms

- You _sign in_ or _sign off_ when accessing an account. You _log on_ or _log out_ of a operating system session.
- Hosting within your organization is _on-premises_. It always has a hyphen and an -s.
- email (n.) is one word, no hyphen. Use "send an email message", rather than "email" as a verb.
- File format abbreviations (PDF, JPEG) should be in uppercase, and filename extensions (.pdf, .jpeg) in lowercase.
- filename is one word
- Finder is the application for browsing folders on a Mac. Apple says to use it as "the Finder", not "Finder".
- administrator should not be shortened to "admin".
- plug-in (n., related to extending functionality, such as for a browser) always has a hyphen. Plug in (v.) without a hyphen describes the action of plugging in a cable.
- The words, internet and web, are lowercase. These have historically been capitalized because they were proper nouns, but the [AP changed this in June 2016](https://twitter.com/apstylebook/status/716279065888563200).

## Best practices for code samples

In command line code blocks, do not include the $ or other prompt text before what the reader needs to type. If you copy the code, you end up pasting extra text. The exception to this is if you are showing a series of commands and responses when including the $ is useful to show which lines are input.
