# Common general terms and writing conventions

Use this style guide in conjunction with other sources of style information, such as a dictionary like [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/), the Microsoft Manual of Style (available in print only), and the [Apple Style Guide](https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf), or the Associated Press Stylebook (available with a subscription). For example, if you want to know how to refer to an item in Mac OS, defer to the term Apple uses for it. This document brings together some of the most commonly encountered terms from those other guides, and may add Mapzen flavor to them.

This list is a living document that will be added to or changed as terminology is encountered.

## Numbers, times, and dates

- Spell out one through nine unless it precedes a unit or is to be input.
- Use numerals for 10 and above.
- Use numerals for all measurements.
- Use 24-hour times, if you can, to consider a global audience.
- Use [ISO standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for calendar dates in documentation because this is the common format Mapzen uses in developer contexts and code. Example: _YYYY-MM-DD_, or _2016-09-05_ for September 5, 2016.
- It is okay to use _month day, year_ in social media or a blog post. However, even in less formal content, avoid ambiguous date formatting, such as 9/5, which could be interpreted as September 5 or May 9, depending on the locale.

## Abbreviations and acronyms

- Spell out a term if you think the audience does not know it. Put the spelled-out term first and the acronym in parentheses, such as API (application programming interface). In most cases, the words that form the acronym or abbreviation are not capitalized.
- Do not add an apostrophe if you make acronym plural (for example, DVDs not DVD's, 1980s not 1980's).
- Abbreviate MB and GB
- Avoid using Latin words, such as e.g., i.e., et al., and etc. Instead, use for example, that is, and others, and so on.
- Do not use the ampersand symbol (&) in text to mean _and_. In that case, spell out the word and. It is okay to use & in appropriate contexts, such as in code samples.

## Titles and headings

- Use sentence-style capitalization (_Only first word capitalized_), rather than title case (_Every, Single Word Gets Capitalized_). Sentence-style is easier to read, and words that are truly proper nouns stand out better.
- Use imperative verbs, rather than gerunds for titles and headings. For example, name a section, "Add a point", rather than "Adding a point". Imperative is clearer and easier to translate.
- Use _Get started_, rather than _Getting started_, in following with the gerund style.
- Nouns or topic descriptions are acceptable for titles and headings, such as _Tutorial_, _Overview_, _API reference_, and _Datastore queries_. If you use a general word like _Tutorial_, make sure what the tutorial will be about is clear from the context of the help section.

## Common words and phrases

- Because, since: use _because_ for causation (because you checked your email, you saw the meeting invitation) and _since_ for a period of time (it's been hours since you checked email).
