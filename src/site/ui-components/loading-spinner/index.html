  <p>Indicates that the interface is waiting for something. We use a lot of different spinners. Here are all the ones we know about. Each spinner is a unique, special snowflake, so rather than having the same spinners everywhere, we really encourage you to express your own individual creativity through spinners. No, I’m just kidding. We’ll consolidate this soon.</p>
